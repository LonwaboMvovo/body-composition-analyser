                    <h2>Weight:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your weight is all the mass that your body contains. Looking into what your 'weight' is composed of can tell if 
                        you are healthy and need to make efforts to keep yourself that way or if you are unhealthy and need to take steps 
                        to get healthy. Not much can be determined by looking at weight alone. 
                        Understanding all your other measurements can help determine what you need to work on to reach your 
                        health and fitness goals.

                    <h2>BMI:</h2>
                    <p>
                        BMI has been used as a standard indicator of health. 
                        Your BMI is calculated by dividing your weight (in kg) by the square of your height (in m). 
                        It is not a perfect system as it does not examine the components of your weight. 
                        For example, a person with a high muscle mass could be classified as being overweight or obese depending on 
                        their height, when in fact they are healthy.
                        On average a person with a BMI: lower than 19 is considered underweight, between 19 and 25 is considered normal and 
                        healthy, between 25 and 30 is considered overweight and higher than 30 is considered obese

                    <h2>Body Fat %:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Body fat percentage is the ratio of fat to your body weight.
                        Your body fat is important as it maintains your body temperature, cushions joints and protects internal organs.
                        It is important however that you keep track of your body fat percentage, as having a high body fat percentage can 
                        cause long term issues. And having a body fat percentage that is too low can also cause problems such as 
                        osteoporosis, irregular periods and infertility. It is very important to keep track of your body fat percentage.
                        Tanita has made body fat ranges which are used in this website to indicate for your age and gender if your body 
                        fat percentage shows that you are underfat, is within a healthy range, overfat or if you are obese.

                    <h2>Visceral Fat:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Visceral fat is the fat located in your abdomen that surrounds and protects the vital organs.
                        Ensuring that your visceral fat is within a healthy range is important as this can reduce the risk of certain diseases 
                        such as heart disease, high blood pressure and may delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. As you age your fat will shift 
                        to your abdominal region, which means that you will have to manage visceral fat levels more the older you get.
                        Having a visceral fat level from 0 to 12 indicates a healthy level and anything above that usually indicates that
                        you have an excessive amount of visceral fat.

                    <h2>Muscle Mass:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Muscle mass is the weight of all your muscles in your body. When your muscle mass increases, the rate at which you 
                        burn energy will increase which will, in turn, increase your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and this will help you reduce 
                        excess body fat. Regular exercise and proper nutrition can increase your muscle mass, which can make it seem that 
                        you are 'gaining weight' and that your efforts are useless but an increase in muscle mass is a good thing. That's 
                        why it is important to monitor your body composition regularly.

                    <h2>Physique Rating:</h2>
                    <p>
                        To determine your physique rating, your muscle and body fat levels are assessed and rates the result as one out of nine 
                        body types. As your activity level changes, the balance of your body fat and muscle mass will gradually change, which in 
                        turn affects your overall physique. A physique rating of 1 means that you have a 'hidden-obese' body type, 2 means that 
                        you have an 'obese' body type, 3 means that you have a 'solidly-built' body type, 4 means that you have an 'under-exercised' 
                        body type, 5 means that you have a 'standard' body type, 6 means that you have a 'standard-muscular' body type, 7 means 
                        that you have a 'thin' body type, 8 means that you have a 'thin-muscular' body type and 9 means that you have a 
                        'very-muscular' body type.

                    <h2>Bone Mass:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bone mass is the weight of all bone mineral in your body. Your bone mass is unlikely to have short term changes but it 
                        is very important to have a healthy bone mass. This can be done with a good diet that includes enough calcium and doing 
                        weight training. You should keep track of your bone mass to notice any changes in the long-term. Tanita has 
                        determined healthy bone masses for your gender and total body weight which this website uses to analyze your bone mass.

                    <h2>BMR:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Increasing muscle mass will accelerate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which increases the number of calories you 
                        burn and helps to decrease body fat levels. Your BMR value can be used as a baseline for a diet program but the more 
                        active you are the more calories need to be added, as using energy burns calories. Being in a calorie deficit you will 
                        generally lose weight and being in a calorie surplus will generally gain weight. Depending on your diet and activity 
                        will determine if you gain or lose fat or muscle.

                    <h2>Metabolic Age:</h2>
                    <p>
                        To determine your metabolic age, your BMR is compared to the average of your age group. If your metabolic age is 
                        higher than your actual age then it means that you need to make efforts to increase your metabolic rate. Increased 
                        exercise and a healthy diet will increase muscle mass which will increase your BMR, thus lowering your metabolic age.
                        Monitor your metabolic age regularly to make sure you stay on track.

                    <h2>Body Water %:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your body water percentage is the total amount of fluid in the body expressed as a percentage of total weight.
                        You will lose water regularly throughout the day from sweat, urine and, breathing. This is why it is important to 
                        hydrate regularly. It is recommended to drink 1l of water for every 30kg that you weigh, but it varies.
                        For a female, the average healthy body water range is 45% to 60% and for males, it's 50% to 60%.
